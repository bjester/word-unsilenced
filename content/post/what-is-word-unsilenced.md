There exists a saying that "silence is golden." Being a quiet person, I've always found it to be an interesting phrase that almost encouraged my reserved nature. The phrase seems to position the act of being silent as a virtue that is at odds with speech, or perhaps just speaking too much. In the Bible, often referred to as God's Word, we've received a message that is, by its very description, God-breathed ([2 Timothy 3:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Timothy+3%3A16-17&version=NIV "2 Timothy 3:16")) and couldn't have been produced in silence. God's spirit lives within it and by the moving of the Holy Spirit within us, the Word is anything but silent.

## In the Beginning

> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was with God in the beginning. Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made. In him was life, and that life was the light of all mankind. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.  
> _John 1:1-5 NIV_

The beginning of the gospel of John is reminiscent of the very beginning in Genesis. God spoke creation into existence and His Word, that became flesh ([John 1:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+1%3A14&version=NIV "John 1:14")), existed long before it walked the earth in human form. Thinking very literally for a second, if the Word became flesh as Jesus, a literal manifestation of God, that spoke with authority as the Son of God, does that mean silence prevailed before the Word became flesh? A quick response would be _no,_ since we have what we deem the Word of God chronologically prior to Jesus that was God-breathed into prophets and writers of the Old Testament. Of course, Genesis also says that the cosmos was spoken into existence so, no, it doesn't seem that God was silent.

The magnificent takeaway is that it _must_ mean that God isn't silent now. For if God was not silent before Jesus, as demonstrated by the preparation for Jesus through prophecy, and Jesus being the Word become flesh, the rebuttal to death's persuasion, then why would God be silent now? In fact, we have been given the gift of the Holy Spirit ([Acts 2:38](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+2%3A38&version=NIV "Acts 2:38")) and it moves within us as we read God's Word. The story has been told and we have been thoroughly prepared by it ([2 Timothy 3:17]()).

## The Need for Silence

The world is a chaotic place. Our own little worlds within which we live can often seem extremely chaotic. They take us to extreme highs and lows. Both good and bad things happen. I've become ultra-aware within the last few days of my need for silence. I've been bombarding myself with music, TV shows, and mobile apps. I'm probably not alone with the feeling that when I drive, I must have music. I actually realized its been awhile since I've driven in silence. The thing about silence, though, is that it has separate effects depending on whether that silence is for input or output.

For myself, I really needed _input_ silence. It's in those times that I'm learning that God is trying to tell me something, but I let the chaos of the world into my mind instead of letting God into my heart. In a particular rough week, to which I can point no particular reason for why I felt so terrible, I became angry with a couple of my friends because of their silence. I had made plans and started executing my vision for a wedding gift for them, only to find out that they had made the existence of my gift obsolete, without telling me they were going to. What entered my mind were thoughts that I didn't matter enough to warrant a text message or call regarding it. I learned later that I let the chaos of their wedding planning, and my own world's chaos, to collide.

My first action, as I struggled with my racing thoughts, was to voice how upset I was, hoping that would enable me to sleep. I didn't sleep very well. My second action was one of silence. I stopped responding to text messages. I isolated myself in silence. That silence, although, was _output_ silence. I feel confident in describing that silence as anything but golden; more like rusty, irritating, and more likely to give you tetanus. I unwillingly broke that silence by reminding myself of the type of person who I believed myself to be, through the feeling that I needed to honor my word and follow through. I joined my friend, the groom, on a trip to a mine to quarry for a quartz crystal containing black tourmaline. I really didn't speak much, but there was great healing in the trip and reminder that my thoughts are sometimes influenced by the chaos around me.

This experience reset me. I came to realize that while I was isolated, I was letting things get between me and my faith. When I came to read the words of John 1 this morning, with an open heart and a clear mind, believing in the silence that surrounded me, I felt true rest. I also decided to create this blog, because in that moment, God's Word burned within me. I found myself, not in an entirely unfamiliar place, scrambling through scripture connecting dots, finding some strange truth in all of it. 

In the beginning, when the spirit of God hovered over the earth that was "without form, and void" (Genesis 1:2), I believe it describes a chaotic place. A place with maximum entropy. Since I was little, I've always imagined those verses describing a silent place. But how could it possibly have been silent be when all the matter and energy of the cosmos suddenly burst into being, without form or purpose? I know imagine it as a traumatic and chaotic place that was anything but silent. That is, until God spoke, and the Word of God formed the world instantly silencing the chaos, reducing its entropy, bringing order and life.

The remarkable thing is that Jesus needed to be silent.

Don't let go of your 

Looking at that from a logical perspective, if Jesus  You could certainly say that Jesus, prior to walking on the earth as a man, was silent. 

Listening, although, doesn't seem to  seems to require a response which would be somewhat in contrast with the saying that silence is golden. 

 The ability to be a great listener is certainly something that is valued in relationships of all kinds.
