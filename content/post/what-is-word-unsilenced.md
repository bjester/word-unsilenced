There exists a saying that "silence is golden." Being a quiet person, I've always found it to be an interesting phrase that almost encouraged my reserved nature. The phrase seems to position the act of being silent as a virtue that is at odds with speech, or perhaps just speaking too much. The ability to be a great listener is certainly something that is valued in relationships of all kinds. In the Bible, often referred to as God's Word, we've received a message that is by its very description, God-breathed. God's spirit lives within it and by the moving of the Holy Spirit within us, we can receive a message that is anything but silent.

## In the Beginning

> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was with God in the beginning. Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made. In him was life, and that life was the light of all mankind. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.

> _John 1:1-5 NIV_

Listening, although, doesn't seem to  seems to require a response which would be somewhat in contrast with the saying that silence is golden.
