Did you know, Jesus prays for you? That thought or concept was of great comfort to me when I made the decision to quit my job. Before making the decision, I spent quite a bit of time in scripture and prayer, seeking some of God's truth. I was struggling with work, feeling depressed and uninterested. I devoted time to deep prayer and investigating scripture. In those moments, I believe God will speak to us, and I found some comforting perspective that lead me to my decision.

## The Growth Strategy

In December of 2016, I was promoted to the position of Growth Engineer. It was an exciting transition because it aligned with where I wanted my career to head. I spent 2017 trying to fully embrace the role while defining what growth meant, since the role was completely new to the company. With the growth strategy in its infancy, naturally there was some conflict with the well established operating flow of the product team. When 2018 rolled around, I decided to undertake a retrospective look at the past year to develop better visibility into how to improve the growth team and strategy in 2018.

My retrospective investigation was supported by my boss, so when I sent my findings to him, I expected some critical feedback and to eventually move forward with the fresh year on a high note of its perspective. But I didn't hear anything. For a few months, I waited for a response. I patiently sent reminders, which were acknowledged. We completed the first quarter of 2018 enduring the same issues and inefficiencies as 2017. From my eyes, it seemed growth was stifled.

Eventually, my boss reviewed my findings. Instead of moving forward with the year utilizing its perspective, my boss informed me things were changing. I wasn't being demoted. If I did a terrible job in 2017 and was being disciplined accordingly, I wasn't told that. Instead, my identity as the growth engineer was stripped away and I was back doing some pretty menial web development work.

To say the least, I didn't really understand what was happening. Prior to becoming the growth engineer, I had spent 4 years on the team, and was starting to feel greatly under utilized and under appreciated. So when I was given the new role, it was a great feeling, and a reason to stick around. When it was seemingly taken away, I was understandably confused, depressed, and started looking for new options. It started to show in my work and my attitude. I started to feel like a failure, and with my growing lack of productivity, I started to become stressed. 

With all of it mounting upon me, I felt my faith starting to become threatened. It was at that time that I started to seek God. Over the past year, not only had my career grown, but so had my faith. I was not alone in feeling that in my church, things were moving and God's hand was building something in the church. My situation was no secret to my friends and family. A friend of mine suggested I listen to a podcast of Erwin McManus speaking on the story of Jesus walking on water.
