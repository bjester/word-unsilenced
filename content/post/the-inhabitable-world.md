I've wanted to visit New Zealand ever since I first laid eyes on pictures reflecting its beauty. If you've seen The Lord of the Rings, you've caught glimpses of that beauty. With a low population density and exotic locale, the down-under islands boast some stunning landscapes. Naturally, I couldn't help but take the leap when I received a price alert for flights to New Zealand last year. I purchased tickets for what would be my first major international adventure. It was an exciting solo trip to a faraway land that was full of rest.

## In the Silence

Last week, one of my friends hosted a prayer group focused on silent contemplative prayer. During the 20+ minutes of silence, I tried to quiet my mind -- my internal dialogue such that my mind focused on silence. It brought me back to an experience I had in New Zealand. My last day there, I made a trip to the west side of the north island. I had spent most of my time on the east side, so I was interested in seeing the more rugged west side.

That morning, I saw a news report on a disease killing trees known by the Maori as kauri. Among the most ancient forests in the world, the kauri are the largest trees on New Zealand, and have special meaning to the Maori. The disease is spread mostly by hikers walking on or very near infected kauri, then transferring it to other kauri by stepping on their roots. The New Zealand government, urged by the Maori, established foot washing stations on trails throughout the affected forests. The issue reached such a tipping point that the Maori decided to declare an unofficial sacred embargo on the hardest hit Waitakere area. They asked that people refrain from recreating in the area or otherwise to strictly follow the rules and wash their boots frequently.

It just so happened that the area I planned to head was straight into the Waitakere ranges. I heavily considered avoiding a hike to a waterfall that I found on a map.
