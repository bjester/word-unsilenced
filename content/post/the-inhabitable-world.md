I've wanted to visit New Zealand ever since I first laid eyes on pictures reflecting its beauty. If you've seen The Lord of the Rings, you've caught glimpses of that beauty. With a low population density and exotic locale, the down-under islands boast some stunning landscapes. Naturally, I couldn't help but take the leap when I received a price alert for flights to New Zealand. I purchased tickets for what would be my first major international adventure. It was a solo trip to a faraway land that was exciting and full of rest.
