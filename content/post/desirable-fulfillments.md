Greetings to you reader! Whatever is happening in your life at this moment, I want to tell you that your life is bigger than the needs and wants of this moment. That God provisioned the best gift of all for you through the sacrifice of His son Jesus. Perhaps you have trouble believing that. If so, I would like to also tell you that you're not alone. While I believe wholeheartedly in the sacrifice of Jesus and the gift of eternal life it gave, I still have trouble believing that God could provision anything else for me. Despite this, I know that love makes no difference between these -- that while Jesus' death was the greatest gift of all, God wants to fulfill all our wants and desires. So for myself and you reader, let's pray that we can let go of this moment's battles and think grandly to the eternal life that is available to us.

## A Heart's Desire for a Desirable Heart

For a long time I told myself "I'll be fine alone." Reflecting on the times that I told myself that, I do believe that I wasn't lonely. I had some strange strengthen in my solitude. It wasn't total apathy towards friendship or finding a girlfriend, I simply knew that either way, I would be okay. As I've grown older, I've started feeling differently. It would seem that loneliness creeps up on you. Within the last few years, I've found myself broken and desiring deep connection.

My desire for deep connection was something that triggered a move, and it helped me get more involved with church. It has made my ever growing faith stronger. Although, I still desire more. I desire companionship. I desire to share life with a woman. I desire to live faithfully with another who challenges me, wants to be challenged, and shares a vision of living for God. Those desires may seem noble. My explanation for their face value is because they come from my heart. My heart is starting to speak louder than anything else, but it hasn't always.

> So then, since Christ suffered physical pain, you must arm yourselves with the same attitude he had, and be ready to suffer, too. For if you have suffered physically for Christ, you have finished with sin. You won’t spend the rest of your lives chasing your own desires, but you will be anxious to do the will of God. You have had enough in the past of the evil things that godless people enjoy—their immorality and lust, their feasting and drunkenness and wild parties, and their terrible worship of idols.

> 1 Peter 4:1-3 NLT

When I told myself that I would be fine alone, my heart was hard. My flesh spoke louder than anything else, and so my actions reflected that. I indulged in whatever made me feel good and I let that rule my life. It was debauchery. I drank and looked at pornography frequently. When I looked at women, it was through the lens of flesh, and my lust drove all interactions. Images of sink holes that are actively swallowing up the surface fill my mind as I try to describe the destructiveness of trying to fulfill those desires.

> Let us walk properly, as in the day, not in revelry and drunkenness, not in lewdness and lust, not in strife and envy. But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to fulfill its lusts.

> Romans 13:13-14 NKJV

My heart was hard; I hold evidence of that. I can see that as time went on, it has softened. When it was hard, I would watch the news and see the terrible things happening in the world and feel almost nothing. Now, sometimes I struggle to watch a TV show let alone the news. It's introspection will rattle my soul and my heart will respond. I can see bits of myself in it.

> Then I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within them, and take the stony heart out of their flesh, and give them a heart of flesh, that they may walk in My statutes and keep My judgments and do them; and they shall be My people, and I will be their God.

Have you ever told yourself certain things that, later, you have reflected on and realized they were untrue? Or perhaps saw through those statements and saw the issue, pain, and/or fear below them? I certainly have. I have told myself that "I'll be fine" when in reality I wasn't fine. I have told myself that
